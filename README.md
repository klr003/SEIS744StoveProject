# SEIS744 Final Project
This is an Arduino project that detects whether a stove was left on and alerts the user of the different stages using an LED.  When I find a pot on the burner, the LED turns blue.  When it detects the pot was removed the LED is yellow.  The LED turns red if the heat is still on and the pot is not there.  Once the temperature has reduced enough the LED turns green.
